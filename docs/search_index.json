["preface.html", "Preface", " Preface This electronic book is a draft for testing out options for posting accessible data tables and reports for CUNY’s Office of Institutional Research. This site was created using RStudio and bookdown using the default settings in the Minimal Book Example, as a base and then customizing it to be more in line with CUNY’s branding by altering the CSS. Data tables were created using the following R packages and functions: kableExtra, DT, and a SUPER helpful function for writing accessible html tables that was written by @dcruvolo and can be found on the RStudio Community post ‘Create accessible HTML tables in RStudio?’.

Problem is that the reason that these columns are formatted so nicely and evenly-spaced is because the header labels are shorter and so the columns do not have to be expanded to fit the text. If we want shorter header names we may have to make more tables with less columns. There’s also no way that I have found so far to format the total rows to be a different color to separate them out from the colleges, so we may want to remove the total and subtotal rows. "],
